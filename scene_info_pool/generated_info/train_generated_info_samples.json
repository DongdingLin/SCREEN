There is limited visibility of its features, but it appears to have a standard lapel and a buttoned front.\n\n2.

This is presumably a polo shirt, although the item is not fully visible in the image so I can't provide accurate details about it.\n\n7. Enclosed in the box is a pair of trousers. They appear to be a professional style, perhaps a dress pant, in a solid dark color that seems to be either dark grey or black.\n\n8. This is a pair of jeans with a blue denim wash. Features such as the pockets and seams are typical of classic jeans design.\n\nPlease note, some of the numbers provided do not correspond with items visible in the provided image, such as number 4, and so I cannot describe them."
