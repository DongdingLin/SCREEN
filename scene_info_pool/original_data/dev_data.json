            "We have several you may like! How about the black one hanging towards the back left, the purple one in front of that or the black on in the left front?",
            "Oh I love the black ones, could you tell me the reviews for those please?",
            "Definitely! The one towards the back has a 2.6 while the one up front has a 2.6.",
            "Oh man, kind of low, rather not take a chance with those. I guess I could have some fund with pants too. Could you show me some denim jeans please?",
            "Sure, how do you like the dark blue ones in the back left, the other dark blue ones to the right of those or the light blue ones to the right of those?",
            "They look a little plain, can you show me more interesting ones?",
            "Unfortunately, we don't have any other denim jeans.",
            "Ok, no problem! I also need a coat, hopefully by the brand Pedals & Gears. Please tell me you have something like that!",
            "We do! Are you interested in the black buttoned one up on wall in the center?"
