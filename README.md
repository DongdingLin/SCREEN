# SCREEN

This repo is the code and synthetic data of the ACM MM 2024 paper "SCREEN: A Benchmark for Situated Conversational Recommendation".

## Dataset

The organized dataset will be uploaded to Google Drive soon and you can download it from the Google Drive link.

## Dataset Construction

### Requirements

The required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Suppose you use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage the Python dependencies, you can install them by running:

```
conda create -n screen python=3.11
conda activate screen
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 1: Prepare the Seed Dataset

We will also upload the organized scene snapshot to Google Driver. Please put it in the `scene_info_pool` in the root directory.

### Step 2: Dataset Construction

Please set your openai key and other related parameters, and then run `dialogue_simulation.py` to start constructing data.

```
# set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""

python dialogue_simulation.py
```

If you hope NOT to show the instructions and the synthesized conversations in the console, please set --show_description and --show_message to false.
